This instance variable isn't actually read by any SKTZoomingScrollView code and wouldn't be necessary if it weren't for an oddity in the default implementation of key-value binding (KVB): -[NSObject(NSKeyValueBindingCreation) bind:toObject:withKeyPath:options:] sends the receiver a -valueForKeyPath: message, even though the returned value is typically not interesting. With this here key-value coding (KVC) direct instance variable access makes -valueForKeyPath: happy.
